                Snake game is a timeless arcade classic constructed using the web technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player takes control of a snake as it slithers around the screen. The main objective is to consume food items that appear randomly on the screen, ultimately causing the snake to increase in length. However, the player must be vigilant and prevent the snake from colliding with the walls or its own body. The game concludes when the snake inadvertently crashes into itself or a wall.
